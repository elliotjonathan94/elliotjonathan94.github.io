A little bit more about me. 

### More Information

I am a Senior Peace War and Defense/History double major at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
I was born and raised a Tar Heel fan in Fayetteville, North Carolina where my family still stays. 
After college I hope to find work in the State Department, and fulfill some form of a diplomatic role in foreign affairs. 
This blog is helping me to learn the basics of webpage design and manipulation, thanks John!
