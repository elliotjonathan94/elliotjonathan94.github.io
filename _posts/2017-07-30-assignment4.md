Well the fourth assignment really had me confused for quite some time... For some reason, I had the most difficulty with MySQL databasing that I had with anything in this class so far.
However, the good thing is that this information has been very beneficial and I have learned quite a bit while stumbling around cluelessly through the software.
I hope to work for the State Department one day, and *data analytics* is most certainly a componenet of their business!
Anyway, here is the [link](https://github.com/elliotjonathan94/elliotjonathan94.github.io) to my actual work with the system and the 'survey' that I used to collect data.
All in all, it was pretty successful. I had some hiccups that I'm not sure I overcame, and it definitely took me a lot longer than it should have to complete it.
But hey, I'm really hoping that late is much better than never!
While I was working with the data, there were several things that were required that were crucial to the success of the operation. 
I had to convert the .csv file into an actual database within the SQL software, and then classify it accordingly into the appropriate tables.
This entails doing things like  1. Designating categories  2. Designating the characters that will be used  3. Creating an exportable database and making a location for it.
I attempted to do all of this through the usage of the handy-dandy bash techniques I learned a little bit ago. 
But I dont think that necessarily worked out... I did however figure my way out of it on the command line. It was a pretty fun task to complete even though it proved to be so arduous for me, and I hope I learn to use this technology better as I get older.
