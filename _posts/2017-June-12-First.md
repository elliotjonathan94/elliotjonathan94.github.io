Learning how to control the functions of ```github``` and ```codeanywhere``` has not come naturally to me.    
I am not a person that you would typically describe as *computer savvy.*  
But I have to admit that it has been pretty handy so far. I never imagined that a computer program such as this would help someone like myself, who pays absolutely no attention to how computers function.  
My basic knowledge with computers has been limited to *making* them function.  
But, now I can say that's not true!  
Thanks to handy programs like **Jekyll,** and the ease of using **markdown** language, I am now writing a blog post!  
Now I can do things like, 
1. make  
2. a  
3. list  
and provide [hyperlinks](http://s2.dmcdn.net/Ub1O8/1280x720-mCQ.jpg) to awesome internet stuff.  
I'm really kind of starting to enjoy this.
