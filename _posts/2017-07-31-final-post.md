Phew... That was a heck of a [final assignment](https://github.com/elliotjonathan94/SLIDESHOW). For starters, I am really bad at determining my own topic. 
But, hey I had to get the work done. I was pretty swamped all weekend with other classes, and I struggled in the times I did work on this to understand what I was doing. 
The whole time I was right there! I just needed a small *nudge* through the door of learning; thanks for that John. 
So I decided that I would create a Reveal.js presentation that talked about one of my favorite activities: kayaking. 
In the presentation, I give some simple explanations for why I enjoy the sport so much, and why I think you would too. 
Check out the slideshow for yourself if you think youre interested!
## Reflective
As this is my last college course of my undergraduate career, I must say I began (and chose) this course with a bit of apathy. 
I have never been very computer savvy, and I really wasn't open to the idea of learning such intricate software so late in my career. 
But I have to commend John Martin for his help and facilitation along the way. 
Because of his instruction and simple pace, I have found myself using tools on the computer that I didn't even know existed before this class. 
Seriously, I had no idea what Linux was man. 
But the thing that I think was most surprising is that I actually **enjoyed** learning how to manipulate different software programs, most especially from the command line!
The information that you have taught me in this class will be invaluable in my future career fields, and I must say thank you for that.
